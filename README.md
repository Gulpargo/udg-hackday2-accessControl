# Rpi3 Access control - UdG Hackday 2
# [UdG Hackday2 - February 17, 2018 @ 9:00 â€“ 20:00](http://hackday.udg.edu/)
This 1st place project was made in less than 12 hours at the UdG Hackday2 hackathon,
we had a raspberry pi 3 and a numpad, we had to make it work without drivers.
We also had to make a website to add users (4 digits for the user, and 4 for the password),
hosting both the databse and website inside the rpi3.

CSS using bootstrap. 
JS using axios for the GET/POST requests.

## Backend
Apache, and PHP to handle the sqlite3 database.

## How does it work
The readKey.py file handles the numpad input so any user can login using the buttons 
(hardest part was making it work with no drivers, no GPIO).
<<<<<<< HEAD
Make sure to put the readKey.py somewhere with rwx permissions.
<b>Be sure to enable SQLite3 on the PHP.ini file!</b>
